    The Kinematic Character Controller is the feature that is the most
    painfully missing from ODE in my personal opinion.

    Some justification for using KCC over DCC.

    I really don't know why, but most of the ODE sources (wiki, mailing list)
    suggest that the best approach to character control with ODE is the
    dynamic controller. Since this might look like the simpler sollution
    (as in "oh, I just need to keep the capsule upwards and ODE will
    do the rest, briliant") it's very, very missleading. Trust me, there
    is a reason why none (as far as I'm aware) of the physics engines
    that provide character controller use dynamic objects for this
    functionality.

    The Dynamic CC, while easy to get started with is extremelly unpredictable
    and difficult to control. As a result they don't act like a character
    capable of conscious movement. This should come as no surprise,
    the dynamic body is meant to be meant to be inert. Characters are not.
    Thus in order to get DCC to move more "character-like" you need to
    put lots and lots of constraints on it up to the point where it becomes
    pointless to even have a body there.

    The sollution to those problems is the Kinematic Character Controller.
    This might sound like a step backwards, because it's strictly collision
    detection based and not physics based, so at first it seems like it's place
    is in the '90s. But in reality using physics where it doesn't belong
    is just pointless.
